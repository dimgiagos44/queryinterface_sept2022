9521467,DNA copy number changes in alveolar soft part sarcoma: a comparative genomic hybridization study.,"Alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS) is a rare, histologically distinctive soft tissue sarcoma typically occurring in children and young adults. Although the tumor often shows focal expression of muscle markers, its relationship with rhabdomyosarcoma is not established. The genetic background of ASPS is poorly understood. This study was undertaken to analyze the DNA copy number changes in 13 cases of ASPS using comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) on formaldehyde-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections. Four ASPS cases showed DNA copy number changes. Gains were more common than losses. Gains observed in more than one case included 1q, 8q, 12q and 16p. Although these findings do not show consistent DNA copy number changes in ASPS, they give preliminary clues to genomic areas that might be important in the pathogenesis of ASPS."

24493828,High-resolution array CGH and gene expression profiling of alveolar soft part sarcoma.,"PURPOSE: Alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS) is a soft tissue sarcoma with poor prognosis, and little molecular evidence exists for its origin, initiation, and progression. The aim of this study was to elucidate candidate molecular pathways involved in tumor pathogenesis.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We employed high-throughput array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) and cDNA-Mediated Annealing, Selection, Ligation, and Extension Assay to profile the genomic and expression signatures of primary and metastatic ASPS from 17 tumors derived from 11 patients. We used an integrative bioinformatics approach to elucidate the molecular pathways associated with ASPS progression. FISH was performed to validate the presence of the t(X;17)(p11.2;q25) ASPL-TFE3 fusion and, hence, confirm the aCGH observations.
RESULTS: FISH analysis identified the ASPL-TFE3 fusion in all cases. aCGH revealed a higher number of numerical aberrations in metastatic tumors relative to primaries, but failed to identify consistent alterations in either group. Gene expression analysis highlighted 1,063 genes that were differentially expressed between the two groups. Gene set enrichment analysis identified 16 enriched gene sets (P < 0.1) associated with differentially expressed genes. Notable among these were several stem cell gene expression signatures and pathways related to differentiation. In particular, the paired box transcription factor PAX6 was upregulated in the primary tumors, along with several genes whose mouse orthologs have previously been implicated in Pax6 DNA binding during neural stem cell differentiation.
CONCLUSION: In addition to suggesting a tentative neural line of differentiation for ASPS, these results implicate transcriptional deregulation from fusion genes in the pathogenesis of ASPS."

19701453,Transgenic CHD1L expression in mouse induces spontaneous tumors.,"BACKGROUND: Amplification of 1q21 is the most frequent genetic alteration in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which was detected in 58-78% of primary HCC cases by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). Using chromosome microdissection/hybrid selection approach we recently isolated a candidate oncogene CHD1L from 1q21 region. Our previous study has demonstrated that CHD1L had strong oncogenic ability, which could be effectively suppressed by siRNA against CHD1L. The molecular mechanism of CHD1L in tumorigenesis has been associated with its role in promoting cell proliferation.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To further investigate the in vivo oncogenic role of CHD1L, CHD1L ubiquitous-expression transgenic mouse model was generated. Spontaneous tumor formations were found in 10/41 (24.4%) transgenic mice, including 4 HCCs, but not in their 39 wild-type littermates. In addition, alcohol intoxication was used to induce hepatocyte pathological lesions and results found that overexpression of CHD1L in hepatocytes could promote tumor susceptibility in CHD1L-transgenic mice. To address the mechanism of CHD1L in promoting cell proliferation, DNA content between CHD1L-transgenic and wildtype mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) was compared by flow cytometry. Flow cytometry results found that CHD1L could facilitate DNA synthesis and G1/S transition through the up-regulation of Cyclin A, Cyclin D1, Cyclin E, CDK2, and CDK4, and down-regulation of Rb, p27(Kip1), and p53.
CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Taken together, our data strongly support that CHD1L is a novel oncogene and plays an important role in HCC pathogenesis."
